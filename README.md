# HW-Diary-Pro
A tool for logging and keeping track of homework in a neat and organized fashion. The site will allow users to view both their current homework and see a record of their homework for the last 30 days. The site will also have a built in focus timer, which will block non-homework sites. Homework can also be tagged (optional) so assignments can be organized and filtered. A premium account membership costs $1 a month and will enable extra features. It also functions as a to-do list for increased productivity and organization. Written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. For information on sources and contributors, see the Sources folder.
